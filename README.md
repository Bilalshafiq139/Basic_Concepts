# Basic_Concepts
understanding of basic Python syntax, including the use of the print() function, variables, different datatypes, and decision-making using if-else statements.

# Fundamentals of Print, Variables, Datatypes, and If-Else

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that introduces basic programming concepts, including:
- The `print()` function
- Variables
- Data types
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)

The script consists of multiple problems designed to strengthen fundamental programming skills.

## **Objective**
The objective of this assignment is to develop an understanding of basic Python syntax, including:
- Using the `print()` function to display output
- Declaring and using variables
- Understanding different data types in Python
- Implementing decision-making using `if-else` statements

## **Problems and Solutions**

### **Problem 1: Temperature Converter**
This program:
1. Takes a temperature input from the user in Celsius.
2. Converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
   ```python
   Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32
   ```
3. Prints both Celsius and Fahrenheit values.
4. Uses an `if-else` statement to categorize the temperature:
   - Below 0°C: Freezing
   - 0°C to 30°C: Moderate
   - Above 30°C: Hot

### **Problem 2: Simple Calculator**
This program:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Asks the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. Performs the selected operation and prints the result.
4. Ensures that division by zero is handled properly.

### **Problem 3: Even or Odd Checker**
This program:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Uses an `if-else` statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
3. Prints the result.

### **Problem 4: Age and Voting Eligibility**
This program:
1. Takes the user's age as input.
2. Uses an `if-else` statement to check if they are eligible to vote (age 18 and above).
3. Prints whether the user is eligible or not.

### **Problem 5: Grading System**
This program:
1. Takes a score (out of 100) as input from the user.
2. Uses `if-else` statements to assign a grade based on the score:
   - 90 and above: A
   - 80-89: B
   - 70-79: C
   - 60-69: D
   - Below 60: F

## **How to Run the Code**
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <project_folder>
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python fundamentals_of_print,_variables,_datatypes,_and_if_else.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter values and see the results.
